## Numpy

### np.where()

- When to us

```python
import numpy as np
a = np.arange(10)
b = np.where(a>5, a, a**2)
print(b)
```

## List

```python
a = [1, 2, 3, 5]
b = a.pop(2)
del a[2]
a.insert(0, 'add')
de
```

Commonly used methods in list :

- delete & pop & remove ï¼ˆWhat are their differences ? )
- insert
- append
- sort(reverse = "True") & sorted, their differences ?
- array.reverse()

## Tuples

tuples variable is immutable, can't be changed.
PEP : Python Enhanced Proposal : standard style of python code

## Dictionary

Dictionary is a key-value pairs variable type.

- What are the difference `dic.get('key', 'no key is found')` and `dic['key']` ? What if the key is not existed in the dictionary, which one would show an error ?
- What if the second parameter of dic.get() is not set, what will python return when the key is not in dic ?

How to loop in a dictionary ? dic.items(), .values(), .keys()

```python
dic = {
	'name' = 'samith',
	age = 20
}
for key, value in dic.items():
	print(key, value)
```

## Function

What to do when there are many arguments pass into function and we don't know all of them. using the star symbol.
What is data type of args ? tuple

```python
def func(*args):
	for element in args:
		print(element)
```

## Module

How to import module ?

```python
import pizza as p
from module_name import function_name as fn
```

## OOP : Class

for class name style : CamelCase (with first capital letter)
instance, attribute, method,

### Inheritance

```python
class ElectricCar(Car):
	def __init__(self, ...):
		super().__init(...)
```

What does above `super()`mean ?

## Python Standard Library

### Random

```python
from random import choice
players = ['messi', 'ronaldo']
selected = choice(players)
print(selected)
```

## File and Exceptions

### File

```python
file_name = "pi_digits.txt"

pi_string = ""

with open(file_name, 'r') as file_object:
	# 'r' read, 'w' write, 'a' append
	for line in file_object:
		pi_string += line.strip()
		print(pi_string)
		print(len(pi_string))
```

using with open(file_name, 'r') -> we don't need to close the file after working in file, it automatically close the file for us.

### File : DictReader()

we can read csv file's data as dictionary

```python
import csv

with open("SeoulBikeData.csv") as file:

rows = csv.DictReader(file)
for row in rows:
	for key in row:
		print(key)
	break
```
