    "text": "Keywords: architecture, overfit, fine-tunning, validation set, test set, weights, parameters, CNN\n\nIntroduction\nDeep learning is common in these day technology. It has been applied in many field such as Computer Vision (CV), Natural language processing (NLP) as well as in Medicine. The first idea of neurons network came from Pitts and McCulloch. Mark I Perceptron The first artificial neuron network was built using the concept from Pitts and McCulloch, but the Perceptron was a single layer neuron network and it couldn’t learn some simple functions (such as XOR).\nPitts and McCulloch form the neurons network idea.\n\n… Trying to spend too much time on theory can be counterproductive. The key is to just code and try to solve problems: the theory can come later when you have context and motivation.\n\nFive areas that DL are good at: natural language processing, medical, security(computer vision), factory(industrial | anomaly detection) and recommendation system(commercial).\n\nThe first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron is : The Mark I Perceptron.\nRequirements for the parallel distributed processing:\n\na set of processing unit\na state of activation\nan output function for each unit\na pattern of connectivity between units\n\nTwo theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neuron networks is:\n\nadding one more layers (2 layer) then it will be possible to approximate any function.\nAdding more layers to make model better\n\nGPU is a kind of processor which can do the parallel computing, it is commonly used in training the model.\nBecause traditional computer does not come with a GPU, hence its computation speed is slow and inefficient.\nSamuel mean by “weight assignment” refer to setting the value of variable on how the function works/behave.\n“weight” is refer to “parameters” in deep learning.\nBecause some problems such as image recognition, we unconsciously know how our brain can recognize patterns in images.\nUniversal approximation theorem.\nData(input) and labels(model output references).\nUsing feedback loop can be problematic, more biased of dataset, the more biased of the model.\nNo, we can use any size, using image of size 264x264 is due to historical reason (traditional model can only trained using 264x264 size).\nClassification : is for predicting the categories of dataset while Regression predict numerical value.\nValidation set is an less exposed data set which is used to find the optimal hyperparameters of various architectures of model. Test set is used to predict the unseen data and evaluate the model overall performance.\nFastai will automatically set the validation set to 0.2 (20%).\nNo, we can’t. A counter case is training with time-series data which is too easy for model to to fill the gap, when we select random validation instances.\nOverfitting is a problem when the model perform very well on training data set but poorly in predicting unseen data. An example : when a model is trained to decide the image is cat or dog, model can only accurately make a classification when given an instance within train dataset. But fail when given cat or dog image outside the training set.\nMetric is a version of loss which used for human consumption, it can be error percentage or accuracy.\nUsing pre-trained model, can increase inefficiency, because pretrained model (already has more capability)can already recognize basic patterns of data.\nHead of a model is the last layer of the model. Note that we need to change the head of model (one or more layers to make it suitable for specifics task of the model) while using pre-trained model.\nThe first layer of CNN, it determines diagonal, horizontal, and vertical edges as well as various gradients. 2nd layer the model detects features within the image such as circle, triangle etc.\nImage models not only useful for photos, for instance, voice signal can also express in term of spectrum in images.\nArchitecture is the pre assume functions or structure of the model.\nSegmentation is task where photos are divided and recognized into small components labels. For example, self driving car might use video data and do the segmentation recognize the pedestrian and adjust direction or speed.\ny_range is used for setting a range in label for specific task.\nHyperparameters are the specification of the model that are manually set by human such as model architecture, learning rate, hidden layers number etc.\nBest way to avoid failures when using AI in an organization is to keep a test dataset separately(without intervening with training process)."

    "text": "The nominative case is one of the grammatical cases in German, used primarily for the subject of a sentence, which is the person or thing performing the action of the verb. It’s also used for predicate nouns or pronouns that refer back to the subject.\nHere are some examples of how the nominative case is used:\n\nSubject of a Sentence: The noun or pronoun that performs the action of the verb.\n\n“Der Hund bellt.” (The dog barks.)\n“Sie liest ein Buch.” (She reads a book.)\n\nPredicate Nouns or Pronouns: Nouns or pronouns that rename or describe the subject in a sentence.\n\n“Mein Bruder ist Arzt.” (My brother is a doctor.)\n“Der Himmel ist blau.” (The sky is blue.)\n\nApposition: When two nouns or noun phrases are used together to describe the same person or thing.\n\n“Meine Mutter, eine Lehrerin, kommt bald.” (My mother, a teacher, is coming soon.)\n“Der Mann, mein Nachbar, ist sehr freundlich.” (The man, my neighbor, is very friendly.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe accusative case is one of the four grammatical cases in German. It indicates the direct object of a sentence, often answering the question “what?” or “whom?” The accusative case is used for the noun or pronoun that directly receives the action of the verb.\nHere are some examples of how the accusative case is used:\n\nDirect Objects: In sentences where the action of the verb is directly applied to something or someone.\n\n“Ich sehe den Mann.” (I see the man.)\n“Sie liest ein Buch.” (She reads a book.)\n\nMotion Toward: When indicating motion towards a specific location.\n\n“Er geht in den Park.” (He goes into the park.)\n“Sie fahren in die Stadt.” (They drive into the city.)\n\nDuration or Time Span: When specifying a duration of time.\n\n“Ich habe den ganzen Tag gearbeitet.” (I worked the whole day.)\n“Wir haben den Film gestern gesehen.” (We watched the movie yesterday.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dative case is one of the four grammatical cases in German (the others being nominative, accusative, and genitive). It indicates the indirect object of a sentence, often answering the question “to whom?” or “for whom?” The dative case is used for the recipient of an action or the object that is indirectly affected by the verb.\nHere are some examples of how the dative case is used:\n\nIndirect Objects: In sentences where something is given or done to someone or something else.\n\n“Ich gebe dem Mann das Buch.” (I give the book to the man.)\n\nCertain Prepositions: Some prepositions in German always take the dative case.\n\n“Ich gehe mit meinem Freund.” (I am going with my friend.)\n“Er spricht mit dem Lehrer.” (He is speaking with the teacher.)\n\nDative Objects with Verbs: Some verbs are used with dative objects, indicating who or what is indirectly affected by the action.\n\n“Ich helfe meiner Schwester.” (I am helping my sister.)\n“Sie glaubt dem Arzt.” (She believes the doctor.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe genitive case is another grammatical case in German, indicating possession or the relationship between nouns. It often answers the question “whose?” or “of whom/what?” The genitive case is used to show ownership, association, or origin.\nHere are some examples of how the genitive case is used:\n\nPossession: Showing ownership or possession.\n\n“Das Auto meines Vaters.” (My father’s car.)\n“Die Farbe des Himmels.” (The color of the sky.)\n\nRelationships: Indicating relationships between nouns.\n\n“Die Stimme der Sängerin.” (The voice of the singer.)\n“Das Land der Träume.” (The land of dreams.)\n\nCertain Prepositions: Some prepositions in German always take the genitive case.\n\n“Wegen des Wetters.” (Because of the weather.)\n“Trotz des Regens.” (Despite the rain.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn German, “ein,” “eine,” and “einen” are all forms of the indefinite article “a” or “an” in English. They are used to indicate the gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter) and case (nominative, accusative, or dative) of the noun they precede.\n\n“Ein” is used for masculine and neuter nouns in the nominative case.\n“Eine” is used for feminine nouns in the nominative case.\n“Einen” is used for masculine nouns in the accusative case.\n\n\nMasculine:\n\nNominative case: “ein” (a)\nAccusative case: “einen” (a)\n\nFeminine:\n\nNominative case: “eine” (a)\nAccusative case: “eine” (a)\n\nNeuter:\n\nNominative case: “ein” (a)\nAccusative case: “ein” (a)\n\n\nCheat sheet:\n\n\n\nIndefinite Article Cheat Sheet"

    "text": "Keywords used in this context: architecture, overfit, fine-tunning, validation set, test set, weights, parameters, CNN\n\nIntroduction and History of Neuron Network\nDeep learning (DL) has become ubiquitous in modern technology. Common applications of DL include natural language processing (NLP), medicine, security (computer vision), industrial automation (anomaly detection), and commercial recommendation systems.\nWhen discussing DL, it is crucial to emphasize its fundamental element: the Neural Network. The concept of neural networks was first developed by Pitts and McCulloch. The Mark I Perceptron was the first artificial neural network constructed based on their ideas. However, the Perceptron was limited to a single layer and struggled to learn some simple functions, such as XOR. To create more powerful neural networks, it is essential to add more layers, which is a common technique in building effective models in DL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTrying to spend too much time on theory can be counterproductive. The key is to just code and try to solve problems: the theory can come later when you have context and motivation.\n\n\n\nThe first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron is : The Mark I Perceptron.\nRequirements for the parallel distributed processing:\n\na set of processing unit\na state of activation\nan output function for each unit\na pattern of connectivity between units\n\nTwo theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neuron networks is:\n\nadding one more layers (2 layer) then it will be possible to approximate any function.\nAdding more layers to make model better\n\nGPU is a kind of processor which can do the parallel computing, it is commonly used in training the model.\nBecause traditional computer does not come with a GPU, hence its computation speed is slow and inefficient.\nSamuel mean by “weight assignment” refer to setting the value of variable on how the function works/behave.\n“weight” is refer to “parameters” in deep learning.\nBecause some problems such as image recognition, we unconsciously know how our brain can recognize patterns in images.\nUniversal approximation theorem.\nData(input) and labels(model output references).\nUsing feedback loop can be problematic, more biased of dataset, the more biased of the model.\nNo, we can use any size, using image of size 264x264 is due to historical reason (traditional model can only trained using 264x264 size).\nClassification : is for predicting the categories of dataset while Regression predict numerical value.\nValidation set is an less exposed data set which is used to find the optimal hyperparameters of various architectures of model. Test set is used to predict the unseen data and evaluate the model overall performance.\nFastai will automatically set the validation set to 0.2 (20%).\nNo, we can’t. A counter case is training with time-series data which is too easy for model to to fill the gap, when we select random validation instances.\nOverfitting is a problem when the model perform very well on training data set but poorly in predicting unseen data. An example : when a model is trained to decide the image is cat or dog, model can only accurately make a classification when given an instance within train dataset. But fail when given cat or dog image outside the training set.\nMetric is a version of loss which used for human consumption, it can be error percentage or accuracy.\nUsing pre-trained model, can increase inefficiency, because pretrained model (already has more capability)can already recognize basic patterns of data.\nHead of a model is the last layer of the model. Note that we need to change the head of model (one or more layers to make it suitable for specifics task of the model) while using pre-trained model.\nThe first layer of CNN, it determines diagonal, horizontal, and vertical edges as well as various gradients. 2nd layer the model detects features within the image such as circle, triangle etc.\nImage models not only useful for photos, for instance, voice signal can also express in term of spectrum in images.\nArchitecture is the pre assume functions or structure of the model.\nSegmentation is task where photos are divided and recognized into small components labels. For example, self driving car might use video data and do the segmentation recognize the pedestrian and adjust direction or speed.\ny_range is used for setting a range in label for specific task.\nHyperparameters are the specification of the model that are manually set by human such as model architecture, learning rate, hidden layers number etc.\nBest way to avoid failures when using AI in an organization is to keep a test dataset separately(without intervening with training process)."
