# CNN 

## Convolution layer

Keywords: Spatial dimension, Depth, Filters Bank, feature maps, Pooling

### Kernel 

**Kernel** refers to a small matrix used for convolutional operations. Convolution is the fundamental operation in a CNN, where the kernel (also called a filter) is applied to input data, typically an image, to produce feature maps.

### Stride

"stride" refers to the number of pixels by which the convolutional kernel moves across the input data at each step during the convolution operation. In below example, illustrate a case when stride = 2.

$$\text{output depth} = \frac{width - filter + 2 \times pad}{stride} + 1$$

### Padding

Padding is a technique used to control the spatial dimensions of the output feature maps after applying convolutional operations to the input data.

Features of padding in CNN:

1. keep the image data near to border edge
1. maintain the size of input image dimension 
1. change the output size of convolution layer

### Pooling

What is pooling ?
: a technique to reduce the activation spatial dimensions/Pooling helps in reducing memory consumption in deeper layers. It is also an important step to convert the spatial information into features. The two most common pooling methods are : **Max pooling** and **Average pooling**
